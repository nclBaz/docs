ASP.NET Core supports [Role based Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles) which allows you to limit access to your application based on the user's role. This tutorial shows how to add role information to the user's ID token and then use it to limit access to your application.

::: note
To follow the tutorial, make sure you are familiar with [Rules](/rules/current).

## Restrict Access Based on User Roles

The SDK expects the role information to exist in the `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role` claim, be sure to use that when adding the roles to the ID Token in the Auth0 rule.

One the ID Token contains the roles in the corresponding claim, you can use the [Role based authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles) mechanism to make sure that only the users with specific roles can access certain actions. Add the `[Authorize(Roles = ?)]` attribute to your controller action.

The sample code below restricts the action only to users who have the `admin` role:

```csharp
// Controllers/HomeController.cs

[Authorize(Roles = "admin")]
public IActionResult Admin()
{
    return View();
}
```
